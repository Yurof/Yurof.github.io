Interview réalisée par Denis, la personne intérrogée est Augustinas Raginskis, un illustrateur freelance

(les réponses et certaines questions ont été reformulées pour faciliter la lecture)

__When did you start as an illustrator ?__
>Around 5 or 6 years ago

__Do you happen to draw a lot of maps for your clients ?__
>A lot of them, I started by a commission from a client who wanted to make a book

__How many of your recents works are maps ?__
>Around 1/4th

__How much time in average, does it takes for a commission of a map ?__
>Worked on maps that take up to 2 months to complete, but on average 8 or 9 days

__Do you like drawing maps ?__
>Yes, although sometimes it becomes boring, especially for maps that take a very long time to complete

__Can you describe me how you deal with maps commissions from clients ? How do you tackle them ?__
>Usually I receive either a written description or a rough sketch from client, then I provide a single sketch of the final map for the client  
that is very detailed and ask them for feedback. Once the sketch is approved, I start drawing the map with regular demos to the client to make sure everything fits their demands. I prefer to do as much as possible in the beginning to make everything easier afterwards.

__Do you need to communicate with anyone for your commission ?__
>The client only

__Do you draw on paper ? Or on a computer ?__
>My work is completely digital, its just more conveniant than paper

__What do your clients need these maps for ?__
>Usually books or tabletop games. Sometimes video games.
But I work only on 2D maps, 3D is not my preference

__Do you sometimes happen to measure your drawings, for example when clients have really specific requests about dimensions ?__
>Often, especially for tabletop games where certains areas of the map need to be pixel perfect

__With what tools do you do these measurements ?__
>My drawing tool

__What tools do you use to draw a map ?__
>A drawing program called Corel Painter, an alternative to Photoshop but any equivalent is enough, no need for fancy tools.  
Occasionnaly, I use a vector program. It's just preference

__You told me you are not interested in applications like Inkarnate (https://inkarnate.com/) to make your maps, why ?__
>Maps produced by such app are not unique. You're very limited in these programs by their own assets.  
For exemple this https://www.artstation.com/artwork/0nLyQG, where I drew every building, is not possible to do on Inkarnate.  
I could see myself using Inkarnate for things like forrest or mountains where everything gets repeated, but even then,  
I wouldnt see myself making the whole map on this, I would add unique things myself.  
These programs gives good placeholder maps though, they are more sketch tools in my opinion.

__Is not using these programs something common among illustrators ?__
>Yes, because you can't create something unique with these programs so there's no creativity. You are limited by this amount of assets that thousands of people already used.  
So there is no point for an illustrator to use a program like that. Our job is to draw unique things in our own style, not generic.

__Have you tried a program like this before ?__
>No, maybe I should have but I wouldnt call what I produce on these programs "my work", so I didn't bother.

__So what can make our program attractive to you ? Any cool features comes to your mind ?__
>For exemple, I would like to being able to import my own assets and with the program arrange everything quicker than with Photoshop.
It's not that it's not possible on PS, it's just not efficient

__QUELQUES IDEES QUI SE DEDUISENT DE CETTE INTERVIEW__  

Permettre à l'utilisateur d'importer ses propres assets  
Permettre à l'utilisateur de dessiner ses propres assets à utiliser dans le programme, pour éviter à l'artiste de switcher trop souvent entre programmes  
Dans la même idée, permettre à notre programme d'envoyer des mails directement au client pour réduire les allers retour programme de dessin <-> boite mail  
Idée proposée par Augustinas : permettre à l'utilisateur de mettre des annotations sur le dessin à l'attention du client  
Exemple de features manquantes sur Photoshop, que Augustinas aurait bien aimé voir : outils de symétrie  
Pour le reste, regarder plus en détail https://inkarnate.com/ qui a l'air d'être la version finale de notre projet
